    * Added IMobility that defines the public C++ interface (and only that) for
      mobility modules.

    * Renamed BasicMobility (because it is not a mobility by itself) to
      MobilityBase.

    * Changed notification mechanism from the NotificationBoard to the OMNeT++
      signalling mechanism. The signal name is 'mobilityStateChanged' and its
      argument is the mobility module itself.

    * Removed the now obsolete NF_HOSTPOSITION_UPDATED notification from the
      NotificationBoard.

    * Updated ManetRoutingBase and ChannelAccess to subscribe to the new signal.

    * Added new base class called MovingMobilityBase that handles updateInterval
      in a general way. Updated subclasses to avoid repeating this code.

    * Properly implement reflectIfOutside and wrapIfOutside when the position
      is further from the constraint area than the area's size. (without loops)

    * Properly implement linear interpolation in LineSegmentsMobilityBase so
      that the current position can be provided at any simulation time.

    * Refactored all mobility models for the new super classes and to support
      providing the current position and speed at the current simulation time.

    * Deleted NoMobility and changed mobility modules to be optional in the hosts.

    * Renamed NullMobility to StationaryMobility to better express its intended
      usage.

    * Copied over and updated TractorMobility from MiXiM.

    * Updated all modules that use mobility and all examples including NED files
      and ini files to work with the new model.

    * Added a couple of new examples to the mobility examples package to be able
      to test all existing models.

    * Added a MobilityAccess class to get a mobility module pointer easily.

    * Fixed relative path in the run scripts for mobility examples.
