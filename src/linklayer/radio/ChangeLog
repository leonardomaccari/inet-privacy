    * Refactored the radio framework. The AbstractRadioExtended has been renamed to 
      Radio. PropagationModel is now configured globally in the channel controller.
      RadioModel is configurable via a parameter instead of overriding a virtual 
      factory method. GenericRadio.cc/.h and Ieee80211.cc/.h is removed as it is no longer
      needed.

    * PathLossReceptionModel.h/cc, Ieee80211Radio.ned: checked in shadowing
    component patch from Nikos Simantirakis (simantirakis@rt-solutions.de).
    "It implements a shadowing component for the path loss reception model.
    This random variable has a normal distribution in dB and results to
    log-normal distribution in mW. This is a widespread and common model
    used for reproducing shadowing effects (Rappaport, T. S. (2002),
    Wireless Communications - Principles and Practice, Prentice Hall PTR)."
