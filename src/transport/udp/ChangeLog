   * UDP: heavy API changes; added multicast, broadcast and ttl support

    Bugs fixed:
    - connect without bind is now supported (used to be an error)
    - send has previously ignored the socket altogether
    - bug: for bind, port=0 was refused
    - it was not possible to receive broadcasts and multicasts

    Features/improvements:
    - added support for the following socket options (see Unix setsockopt()):
      time-to-live (unicast and multicast), broadcast, multicast output
      interface, join multicast group, leave multicast group.
    - UDPControlInfo was as a bit confusing, as it contained the union of
      all fields needed for all commands/indications, so it was not
      clear whether some field X was used for some command/indication,
      and if so, what its exact role was. Specific UDPControlInfo classes
      are now much more explicit about this.
    - UDPSocket class now contains much less state (clearer responsibilities,
      less chance of disagreement with UDP module's view)

    Details:
    - UDPControlInfo has been split to:
         UDPBindCommand,
         UDPConnectCommand,
         UDPSendCommand,
         UDPCloseCommand,
      and
         UDPDataIndication,
         UDPErrorIndication
      for the opposite direction. Used with the corresponding
      UDP_C_xxx and UDP_I_xxx message kinds.
    - UDP_C_UNBIND message kind has been renamed to UDP_C_CLOSE
    - added UDP_C_SETOPTION (for setting socket options);
      it must be acompanied by any of:
         UDPSetTimeToLiveCommand,
         UDPSetBroadcastCommand,
         UDPSetMulticastInterfaceCommand,
         UDPJoinMulticastGroupCommand,
         UDPLeaveMulticastGroupCommand.
    - the "unspecified" port number value has been changed from 0 to -1,
      for consistency with other parameters in the NED file
    - userId was removed, as it hasn't offered a tremendous utility
      value, and apparently nobody used it

    UDPSocket class:
    - now it stores minimal state (practically just the socket id),
      and everything else is immediately sent down to the UDP module
    - new methods for socket options:
         setTimeToLive(),
         setBroadcast(),
         setMulticastOutputInterface()
         joinMulticastGroup()
         leaveMulticastGroup()
    - new utility method:
         getReceivedPacketInfo()
    - removed methods:
         setUserId() / getUserId() -- userId is no longer;
         getState() / stateName() -- state is not kept;
         getLocalAddress() / getLocalPort() -- state is not kept;
         setMulticastInterfaceId() / getMulticastInterfaceId() -- renamed
