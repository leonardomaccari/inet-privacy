this model implements a dual-slope pathloss model, as in the paper
described in http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1416323&bnc=1 and
http://books.google.com/books?id=VbCCJhjO4OcC&lpg=PA79&dq=dual-slope%20path%20loss%20coefficients&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false

Basically is a pathloss model with two 
coefficients, one to be used before the breakpoint distance, and another
to be used after. This mimics the possibility of having freespace up to 
a certain distance and obstruction of some obstacles after that 
distance. The second reference implements a correction factor to avoid
sharp edges in the transition 


Example to test the DualSlopeModel, expect to have a higher power decay than
freespace (default alpha values are 2,4) or a power decay with two steps and a
knee at the breakpoint distance (depending on the smoothStep parameter).

If in DualSlopeModel.cc you enable DEBUGMODEL you can reproduce the graphs that
are in this folder, unsmoothed.png and smoothed.png. To do this:
 -  ./run -u cmdenv -c TestDualSlope 2> plot.txt
 -  open gnuplot and type: plot 'plot.txt' using 1:2 ti "freespace", 'plot.txt' using 1:3 ti "unsmoothed"

do the test with both smoothStep values
